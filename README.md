## **Flight Delay Prediction**

- The **_Flight Delay Prediction_** API finds the probability that a specific flight will be delayed.
- The API provides delay probabilities for four‚úå‚úå possible delay lengths: Less than 30 minutes. 30-60 minutes. 60-120 minutes.
  

## **Getting Started**

It‚Äôs all about **Delay prediction** so there's nothing much to have in your üñ•Ô∏è**System**, just open your browser and type **_Google colab_** and start the code given above
And **code** will come in handy. Once you open **Google Colab** will be easy to access

## **Pre-requisites**

- You can use **Vs Code IDE** if you are comfortable in your üñ•Ô∏è**System**.
- This **IDE,** this **IDE** gives some shortcuts while writing code.
- I prefer to use **VS Code** because it is used for all programming languages. But most of them use different **_IDE_** for different languages.


## **Installation**

- Want to learn with my code by editing:

- It‚Äôs pretty straightforward‚è©:
